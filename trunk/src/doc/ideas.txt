Brain storming:

--------------
1. XML file at server containing a list of server methods
and a list of permissions for every method. Load the file as a singleton
when starting server and check values instead of change the code into the 
methods, i.e:
    <class="classX" method="methodX">
        <permissionCheck name="Permission.Create" description="This method must check that not everybody can create"
        <permissionCheck name="Permission.Read" description="This method must check that not everybody can read"
    </class>
